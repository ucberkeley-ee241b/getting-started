Software Overview
===================

In your future IC design career, you will likely be using software from this (non-exhaustive, not-quite-up-to-date-name-wise) list:

* **Synopsys**
  * **VCS*** for functional verification
  * **Design Compiler (DC)*** for digital synthesis
  * **IC Compiler (ICC)*** for place and route
  * **PrimeTime*** for timing and power analysis 
  * **Liberty NXC*** for standard cell library characterization (Liberty file .lib generation)
  * **Library Compiler*** for creating standard cell libraries (Milkyway files) 
  * **Formality** for formal verification
  * **Hercules***
    * **DRC** for layout design rule checks
    * **LVS** for consistency checking between layout/schematic
  * **StarRC*** for parasitic extraction
* **Cadence**
  * **Virtuoso*** for "analog-y"/mixed-signal schematic design, layout, and verification
  * **Genus** for digital synthesis
  * **Innovus** (formerly SOC Encounter) for  place and route
* **Mentor Graphics Calibre**
  * **nmLVS** for consistency checking between layout/schematic
  * **nmDRC** for layout design rule checks 
  * **xRC** for parasitic extraction
* **HSpice*** for transistor characterization
* **Matlab*** for design analysis

> Minimally, you will be using *'d software for EE241B ASIC labs and projects.
